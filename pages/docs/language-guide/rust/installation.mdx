## WASIX installation for Rust

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="default" emoji="âš™">
  Wasix depends on the `rustup` toolchain manager. If you don't have `rustup`
  installed, you can install it by following the instructions at
  [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
</Callout>

To install the Wasix toolchain for Rust, run the following command:

```console copy
$ cargo install cargo-wasix
```

The above command will install four things:

1. The `cargo-wasix` command-line tool
2. The `wasix` toolchain for `rustup`
3. The `wasix` target for `rustup`
4. The `wasix` target for `rustc`

#### Verifying the Installation

Verify that the `cargo-wasix` command-line tool was installed correctly by

```shell
$ cargo wasix --version
cargo-wasix 0.1.17
```

Check that the `wasix` toolchain was installed correctly by running:

```shell
# may require first `cargo wasix build` e.g.: cargo new xx; cd xx; cargo wasix build
$ rustup toolchain list | grep wasix
wasix
```
